Personal Blog.

Hi, I am an enthusiastic person that is always looking forward to learning new stuff.
I have started my git hub journey trying to understand git to use it as an exceptional tool to learn programming.
I have already gotten pretty far in html as well as css and am looking forward to learning more capable languages like js.
I love arts and game development despite thinking it can be a nightmare.
I still don't know what I want for my future for now I am only trying to open more doors.

updates: Waiting for the first step on this website..
